# React: Groupeton ride schedual 

### Planning
I decided to create a biking application that let users schedule their upcoming rides and have them all in a central location for future reference.  Originally, this was a passion project that I only created the wireframes and the designs for. But I then decided to take the wireframes and build it while taking the opportunity to learn React. 

### Learning React 

In order to complete this project I needed to gain a better understanding of React. React was something we were never taught in school so I had to take it upon myself to learn it. Thankfully, the React website and linkedin learning  had the tools necessary to learn. And with my previous javascript skills, the translation was manageable 

### Database integration.

In order to keep a record of which user created which ride, I needed to store this information inside a database. Firebase was something that I have never used before and wanted to take this opportunity to learn it. 

### Reflection

Along the way there were many challenges that I had to overcome inorder to create this application. Getting comfortable with react was the biggest hurdle to overcome. At first I wanted to get the answers quickly and simply have the code working, but like many things in this industry , you must be patient and spend the extra hours reading the documentation thoroughly. 
I found myself getting a better understanding of component based programming and how beneficial it is to separate different components for not only readability but also scalability.
